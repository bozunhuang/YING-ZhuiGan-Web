        From deepness within earth,
        Emerges the noble life from:
        Fat, white, wholesome,
        Edible gods of death,
        Sprouting from eyesockets,
        From waterlogged soil,
        Like vigorous balcony flowers
        Laughing at a funeral.

        In some cultures, white is the semaphore of death.
        So pale, so pointless, the color of salt.
        It is seen not as the opponent of black,
        But the opponent of all colors.
        Devoid of purpose as restrained chaos:
        The inside of dead bamboo
        Crumbles into faithless muddles.
        Mycelium is found in parts of human
        brain that conceptualize death.

        Death is a tangible concept born from the breaths
        of a meditating person.
        Death is an actualized token condensed from the air
        Like some dirty crystal.
        Death is a bronze sword from ancient China
        Hanging over your head.
        The blade's sharpness' cold glare
        Grabs your neck form behid,
        Leaving frosting handprints,
        That remains
        In ones life.

        Where do we go?
        We merge with the soil
        Because our flesh worships death,
        And our brains are made of mycelium.
